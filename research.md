## Classification of Hand Gestures using SEMG Signals with Force Variation for Transradial Amputees
- Proposed a new feature set for discriminating SEMG signals corresponding to six different hand gestures from amputee subjects.
- Presented a channel selection algorithm to find the optimal number of channels.
- Proposed a classification method using SVM along with new feature sets and channel selection algorithm which outperforms other classification method significantly (upto 10%) at high force level.
